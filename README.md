## What is this book about?
SOLIDWORKS is a dominant computer-aided design (CAD) software for the 3D modeling, designing, and analysis of components. This book helps you get to grips with SOLIDWORKS Simulation, which is a remarkable and integral part of SOLIDWORKS predominantly deployed for advanced product performance assessment and virtual prototyping.

This book covers the following exciting features:
Run static simulations with truss, beam, shell, and solid element types
Demonstrate static simulations with mixed elements
Analyze components with point loads, torsional loads, transverse distributed loads, surface pressure loads, and centrifugal speed
Explore the analysis of components with isotropic and composite materials
Analyze members under thermo-mechanical and cyclic loads
Discover how to minimize simulation errors and perform convergence analysis
Acquire practical knowledge of plane elements to reduce computational overhead

## Get to Know the Author
**Khameel B. Mustapha**
Khameel B. Mustapha obtained his doctorate from Nanyang Technological University (Singapore) with a focus on the development of computational methods in the area of microcontinuum theory. He has years of experience working on a variety of finite element analysis platforms. Khameel has given training to thousands of students and participants on the applications of finite element simulations to the analysis, design and performance assessments of engineering components. His primary research interest gears towards mechanics and modelling of microscale structures, but his wider interest encompasses computational mechanics, engineering teaching philosophy and mechanics of advanced systems (functionally graded materials, sandwich composites, subcellular biological structures, energy materials, additively manufactured components). He is currently an Associate Professor with the University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus, and has previously held a faculty position with the Swinburne University of Technology (Sarawak). He is a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA).
